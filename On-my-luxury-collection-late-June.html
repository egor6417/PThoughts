<h1>On my luxury collection, late June</h1>

<p>My collection now has two aspects- things I need and things I want. Both of them I will settle by buying luxury stuff, but the two aspects differ greatly in brands.</p>

<h3>Things I need</h3>

<p>Because I do not have a great income, I cannot buy practical things like cardholders and bags from top-of-the-line luxury brands like Hermes, and I'll need to settle for Louis Vuitton.</p>

<h3>Items I desire</h3>

<p>These items are bought about twice a year, and I save up for them, and therefore can't afford to buy overpriced products from the likes of Hermes or Cartier.</p>

<h3>In terms of the future</h3>

<p>And as I am forming my wishlists for the next few years, a theme starts to appear- I'm done collecting the staples, the LV Cardholder being last in that collection. The main focus until 2020 will be buying perfume, jewelry and small leather goods. Here is my wishlist as of 24.06.17 15:58:54 MSK:</p>
